- [x] @claude update the documentation in this codebase - namely, in `docs/`, add an ARCHITECTURE.md and COMPONENT_IDEAS.md. In root, update the CLAUDE.md file for the current version. All documentation in this codebase must follow a format using YAML frontmatter. The required keys are `created`, `modified`, `app_version`, and `commit`. The systematics for creating new documentation should be clarified and stated in CLAUDE.md, and is MANDATORY. The main systematics of the codebase (how it works) go in ARCHITECTURE.md, while the systematics of how *to* work go in CLAUDE.md (the documentation thing mentioned before). CLAUDE.md should expicitly state that all other documentation besides CLAUDE.md lives in `docs/`.
- [x] @claude clean up unnecessary/non-clarifying comments throughout the codebase. add jsdoc where approriate
